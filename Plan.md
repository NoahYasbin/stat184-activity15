# Project Goals (Activity #14)

- Submit the PDF and QMD files created for Activity #14.

- Organize the files in a public GitHub repository so the instructor can verify all requirements.

- Demonstrate an understanding of GitHub workflows through branching, issues, commits, and pull requests.

# Repository Goals
- Keep the main branch clean, organized, and ready for grading.
- Use a development branch (dev) to make changes before merging them into main.
- Document tasks using GitHub Issues and show progress by closing issues with pull requests.
- Make meaningful, frequent commits with clear commit messages.

# Needs
- A public GitHub repository dedicated to Activities 14 and 15.
- At least two branches: main and dev.
- Understanding of basic git workflow: branching, committing, pushing, pull requests, and merging.
- Clear file structure, consistent commit messages, and organized documentation.

  # Steps
1. Create and publish the repository
   - Create a new public GitHub repository and initialize it with a README.
   - Create a dev branch from the main branch to use for updates and edits.
2. Track tasks with GitHub Issues
   - Open Issues for tasks such as “Add Activity 14 PDF and QMD files” and “Update README with overview and plan”.
3. Work on the development branch
   -  Make edits and add files on the dev branch instead of directly on main.
   -  Commit frequently with meaningful messages that describe exactly what changed.
4. Use Pull Requests to merge changes
   - Open a Pull Request from the dev branch into main.
   - In the PR description, reference and close issues (e.g., “Closes #1”).
   - Review the changes and merge the PR so that main stays up to date.
5. Maintain the repository
