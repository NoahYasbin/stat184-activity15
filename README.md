# stat184-activity15

# What is in this file
This repository is used for STAT 184 Activity 15 (GitHub Practice).
It stores my work for Activity 14 and shows that I can use GitHub for version control, including branches, issues, commits, and pull requests.

# Data
All data in Activity 14 was provided by the STAT 184 data files through Canvas.

# Plan for the Project
1. Have a copy of the Activity 14 report pdf and the corresponding QMD file.
2. Use this repository as an example of proper GitHub practice for STAT 184.
3. Have an up to date main branch that includes all merged changes from development branches.
4. Use Issues and Pull Requests to document future changes if the repository needs to be changed.
